line 4-6: No documentation in space set aside for documentation.

line 76: As this is a non-standard way of finding out if something is of type number, you might want to comment this line.
Alternative, you might just use the function is isnumeric http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_isnumeric.htm . 
This still leavews the case of someone inputing a fraction like 1.1, so you might want to check to find out the behavior
in those cases.

line 8-9: Vestigial init, if you aren't planing on expanding on this later, you might simply delete these lines.

line 16, 19: Functions with no doc strings. While it isn't key, docstings tie into auto-documentation tools, so even for limited
functions like these they can be useful.

line 35-39: While programers don't mind starting at zero, lots of people don't like it. You can offset by one simply by adding
or subtracting one, to make it more user friendly.

Controller

line 14-40: Very little documentation of your logic. It's good to give each section a header, simply to make what your doing where
clear, not just to other poeple, but to yourself in the future.

line 20-23: You are reaching into other functions here. While this isn't a bad thing exactly, some think you should create functions
that do that for you, so that your main function isn't directly interaction with other objects. Just to be clear, this isn't 'wrong'
to do, and some poeople feel this is the correct way. It's just a fyi.

line 20-23, 25-27, 29-33, 35-38: Each of these seem to be a self-contained logical block. You might spin some of these off
into their own functions, so that less game logic is embeded into you main play function.





Your overall program seems solid. My biggest worry is that you don't comment enough.
